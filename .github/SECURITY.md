# Security Policy

The sealpack community takes the security of its code seriously. If you
think you have found a security vulnerability, please read the next sections
and follow the instructions to report your finding.

## Security Context

Open source software can be used in various contexts that may go far beyond
what it was originally designed and also secured for. 
Nevertheless, due to the nature of this tooling, we don't expect cdxlr to be 
used in security-sensitive scenarios.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel
(mailing list, github issue etc.). Instead, contact the maintainer 
mathias.haimerl@innomotics.com via email directly. Please provide a detailed 
description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, the affected versions and, 
if already available, a proposal for a fix. You should receive a response 
within 5 working days. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability by us, 
we will open a Security Advisory on github and give credits for your report if 
desired. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
